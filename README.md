 C++ Algorithms Showcase
=================================================

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This repository is my personal space for coding, exploring, and implementing various algorithms using C++.

## Description

In this collection, you'll find my implementations of a range of algorithms, from fundamental data structures to more complex problem-solving techniques. I'm using C++ for its performance, control, and the ability to work closely with memory, which is often crucial for understanding and optimizing algorithmic performance.

My goal here is twofold:

1.  **To deepen my own understanding**: Actively coding these algorithms helps solidify the concepts.
2.  **To share with others**: If you're learning C++ or algorithms, I hope these examples can be a helpful resource.

You'll find that the code is commented to explain the logic and the steps involved in each algorithm. I'm striving for clarity and correctness in each implementation.

## What's Inside?

Here you'll find implementations covering areas like:

* Sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
* Searching algorithms (e.g., Binary Search, Linear Search)
* Computer vision algorithms (e.g., OpenCV codes)
* Graph algorithms (e.g., BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's)
* Dynamic Programming problems
* Data structures (e.g., Linked Lists, Trees, Hash Tables)
* And more as I continue to add to it!

## Getting Started

Most of the code is written in standard C++. You should be able to compile the `.cpp` files using any modern C++ compiler like g++ or Clang.

For example, to compile a file named `my_algorithm.cpp`:

```bash
g++ my_algorithm.cpp -o my_algorithm -std=c++17
